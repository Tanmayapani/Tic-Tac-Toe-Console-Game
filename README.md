# Tic-Tac-Toe-Console-Game

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game**! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed to be played in the console. It supports two players, `X` and `O`, who take turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Two-Player Game**: Play against a friend on the same device.
- **Interactive Console Interface**: The game board is displayed in the console, and players input their moves using row and column numbers.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that players enter valid moves and prevents overwriting existing moves.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the program in your C++ environment.
2. **Enter Moves**: Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers (0-2) where they want to place their mark (`X` or `O`).
3. **Win or Draw**: The game ends when a player wins by getting three of their marks in a row or when the board is full (resulting in a draw).
4. **Play Again**: Restart the program to play another round.
